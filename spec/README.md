#Written Reflection

1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.

It was defintely challenging to start iteration 3 without an interaction pattern that we were used to in the previous iterations. It leaves the door open for creativity and structuring this part of the project how we want to. Our approach was to break each section of the iteration into their own methods. This made it seem more manageable and we felt like it would be easy to read if we broke it up piece by piece. 

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

If we had one more day to work on this project, we would focus on the game class and make sure we can play the game to completion. We would have to create a few more methods and also we would like to have the methods flow with one another in relationship with the runner file. Right now we have multiple lines in the runner file but we would like to refactor the runner and have the game flow through the code. 

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

We would do a combination of independent work and working together in a driver/navigator style. We would try to explain the code we did separately as we implemented it. We then tried to take turns submitting pull requests to keep the work load about even. 

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

For the most part, we gave direct feedback while we were on calls and implementing code. When disagreements came up, we would try to talk through them directly on calls and make changes accordingly.
